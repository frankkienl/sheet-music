Sheet music by frankkienl

Why
---

I want to learn to play the ocarina. 
And I wanted to start with some simple songs. 
Children's songs are simple.
But the sheet music I could find was mostly made for piano, and/or didn't contain lyrics.
Therefore I made these versions, that should be easy to play on the ocarina and also have lyrics.

How
---

The songs are created using LilyPond, via https://www.hacklily.org/  
This website provides an editor and can export to PDF.


What is an ocarina?
-------------------

It's a musical instrument, I printed one with my 3D printer.
